1. [Absolute value](ocaml-basics/absolute-value/)
1. [From type to function #1](ocaml-basics/fun-of-type-1/)
1. [Find a function #1](ocaml-basics/find-fun-1/)
1. [Highest card wins](ocaml-basics/highest-card-wins/)
1. [From type to function #2](ocaml-basics/fun-of-type-2/)
1. [Even and odd](ocaml-basics/even-odd/)
1. [Comparing fractions](ocaml-basics/fractions/)
1. [Reverse a list](ocaml-basics/rev-list)
1. [Minimum of a function](ocaml-basics/minfun)
1. [Fibonacci sequence](ocaml-basics/fibonacci-seq)
1. [Student grades](ocaml-basics/cumlaude)
1. [Duplicates](ocaml-basics/dup)
1. [Random list](ocaml-basics/rnd-list)
1. [From list to string](ocaml-basics/string-of-list)

## Arithmetic expressions

1. [A minimal language of boolean expressions](expr/boolexpr)
1. [Boolean expressions with not, and, or](expr/andboolexpr)
1. [Typed arithmetic expressions with dynamic type checking](expr/arithexpr)
1. [Typed arithmetic expressions with static type checking](expr/sarithexpr)
1. [Untyped arithmetic expressions](expr/uarithexpr)
1. [Arithmetic expressions with let bindings and dynamic type checking](expr/letarithexpr)

## Imperative languages
